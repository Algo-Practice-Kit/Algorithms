# Algorithms

Hi everyone, I hope we can together accumulate algos and help each other with the algo practice routine.
I think each of us can create our your own folder to save your work,and it could be the references for our member as well.

### Some suggestions
1. Tool and language
- Feel free to pick language/ tool to write your code and taking note.
I highly recommend using markdown to write down cause I think it is really easy for you to review later on.
- Markdown syntax: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
  if you use markdown, I also recommend you use extension:
  - Markdown All in one
  - Markdown Preview Enhanced (after you install this, you can right click and choose review, you will see your work =) )

2. Organize
    - Each person have one folder with their name
    - Inside your folder, you can have more folders for your references. Example:
        - Array
        - String
        - Linked list
        - Tree
        - Binary tree
        - ...
3. Command message structure best practice:
    - Action : simple tense verb : add , fix , ...
    - Field: field name: array/ string ...
    - Illustate your work
 Example:
  `add(array): two number sum`
