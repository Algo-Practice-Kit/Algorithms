## Prompt

Write a program to check if two given String s1 and s2 are rotations of another.
_For example_
if s1 = "IndiaUSAEngland" and s2= "USAEnglandIndia" then your program should return true but if s2="IndiaEnglandUSA" then it should return false.

## Extra Information

- For the purpose of this program, you can assume that Strings are rotated on the right side, but you should ask this question to your interviewer before jumping into the solution.

## Examples

```
let string= 'IndiaVsAustralia'
let rotation= 'AustraliaVsIndia'
Output: false
```

```
let string= 'IndiaVsEngland'
let rotation= 'EnglandIndiaVs'
Output: true
```

## Follow Up Questions

(In Java)
There are a couple of variants of this program that many interviewers ask as follow-ups e.g. how do you solve the problem if strings are rotated on the left side, or can you check if two strings are the rotation of another without using String concatenation. You can try solving those versions by yourself, but if you want to look for a solution, you can check it below.
