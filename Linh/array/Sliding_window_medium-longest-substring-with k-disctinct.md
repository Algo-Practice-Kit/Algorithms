# Longest Substring with maximum K Distinct Characters (medium)
# Prompt:
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it with no more than `K` distinct characters.
# Example 1
- input: `string ="araaci"`; `k=2`
- output: 4
- Explanation: the longest substring with no more than `2` distinct characters is `araa`
# Example 2:
- input: `string ="araaci"`; `k=1`
- output: 2
- Explanation: the longest substring with no more than `1` distinct characters is `aa`
# Example 3:
- Input: String="cbbebi", K=3
- Output: 5
- Explanation: The longest substrings with no more than '3' distinct characters are "cbbeb" & "bbebi".
# Example 4:
- Input: String="cbbebi", K=10
- Output: 6
- Explanation: The longest substrings with no more than '10' distinct characters is "cbbebi"
